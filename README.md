# Machine Learning

These are the programming assignments from 
[Coursera's Machine Learning course][ML] taught by Andrew Ng.

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and
statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning
(parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural
networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction,
recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning
(bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that
you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots
(perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer
vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
